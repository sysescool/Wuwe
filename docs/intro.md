# Wuwe overview

Wuwe is a C++20 framework for building tool-using, stateful, and auditable AI agents in native applications, services, and command-line programs.

Root-scoped filesystem tools and allowlisted process execution provide reusable
local operations without making an unrestricted shell the default integration
surface.

Its modules are independently usable. A host can start with one provider client and typed tools, then add reasoning, planning, memory, retrieval, MCP, or controlled execution only where needed.

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| LLM providers | Provider configuration, normalized requests and responses, streaming, retries, and errors |
| Context budget | Unified allocation across system prompts, conversation, memory, retrieval, tool schemas/results, and reserved output |
| Resource routing | Capability-aware model profiles, token and cost budgets, and dynamic model selection |
| Tools | Typed schemas, JSON argument parsing, dispatch, and provider composition |
| Filesystem | Root-scoped reads, writes, exact edits, search, transfer, revisions, approvals, and audit |
| Process | Allowlisted argv execution, bounded I/O, process-tree cleanup, and an opt-in shell adapter |
| Reasoning | Simple, ReAct, reflect-and-retry, plan-execute, and Best-of-N runs with budgets and traces |
| Reflection | Rule-based or model-based evaluation, revision guidance, policy, and persistence |
| Planning | Plan generation, validation, dependency execution, retries, replanning, approvals, and checkpoints |
| Multi-Agent | Agent registry, roles and skills, lifecycle, capacity, shared sessions, parallel work, consensus, and Planning dispatch |
| A2A | Agent Card discovery, remote Messages, Tasks, Artifacts, JSON-RPC/HTTP transport, and local/remote Agent adapters |
| Guardrails | Ordered input/output and runtime-boundary checks with modification, denial, approval, audit, and telemetry |
| Evaluation | Weighted output, structured-result, and trajectory regression suites |
| Learning and adaptation | Experience and reward ledgers, versioned artifacts, offline optimization, regression gates, approval, activation, and rollback |
| Exploration and discovery | Bounded hypotheses, approved experiments, evidence review, confidence thresholds, persistence, and explicit evidence export |
| Orchestration | Typed flows with branching, bounded fan-out/fan-in, filtering, retry, cancellation, recovery, and routing primitives |
| Memory | Scoped records, context injection, persistence, ranking, embeddings, and model-visible tools |
| Knowledge / RAG | Loading, splitting, indexing, retrieval, reranking, grounding, and citation support |
| MCP | Server, client, host, gateway, stdio, process, and HTTP integration |
| Networking | A common HTTP interface with cpr/libcurl and cpp-httplib backends |
| Capability policy | Explicit authorization decisions for sensitive actions |
| Approvals | Host-controlled approval requests and decisions |
| Audit | Structured event sinks for security-relevant operations |
| Controlled execution | Policy-bound Python subprocess execution with limits and cancellation |
| Sandbox contracts | Isolation and enforcement capability descriptions exposed by execution backends |
| Observability | Common events, module observers, traces, metrics adapters, and host-owned sinks |
| Agent Host protocol | Versioned, transport-neutral run, approval, resume, cancellation, and event contracts |
| Storage contracts | Explicit durability, transaction, migration, replay, and coordination guarantees |

## Release boundary

Version 1.0.0 is verified on Windows x64 with Visual Studio 2022 and Ubuntu 24.04 Linux x64. macOS portability is an engineering goal, but macOS is not part of the 1.0.0 certification matrix.

The release is an SDK, not a hosted agent product. Applications retain ownership of user identity, secrets, UI, storage policy, approvals, and deployment topology.

Optional capabilities stay explicit:

- Windows uses Schannel by default; Linux release builds use OpenSSL.
- SQLite is required by the official release presets but remains configurable for custom builds.
- Default packages bundle Tika and a platform-specific Java 21 runtime for document parsing; either runtime component can be omitted for core-only or host-managed deployments.
- Qdrant and other remote indexes are external services configured by the host.
- `controlled_process` applies policy and resource limits but is not a strong isolation boundary.

## Start here

1. [Build and run Wuwe](getting-started.md).
2. Configure an [LLM provider](llm-providers.md) and [typed tools](llm-tools.md).
3. Compose the [agent runtime](agent-runtime.md), optional [Agent Host protocol](agent-host-protocol.md), [orchestration](orchestration.md), [reasoning](reasoning.md), [planning](planning.md), [multi-agent runtime](multi-agent.md), [reflection](reflection.md), [learning and adaptation](learning-adaptation.md), or [exploration and discovery](exploration-discovery.md) layer you need.
4. Add [memory](memory-management.md), [knowledge retrieval](knowledge-retrieval.md), [MCP](mcp.md), or remote [A2A](a2a.md) interoperability.
5. Review [security and governance](security-governance.md), [observability](observability.md), [storage contracts](storage-contracts.md), [dependencies](dependencies.md), [packaging](packaging.md), and [controlled execution](execution-runtime.md) before deployment.
