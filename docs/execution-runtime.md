# Controlled execution

The execution module exposes Python snippet execution as a policy-bound runtime and optional model tool. It separates authorization from backend enforcement and reports what each backend actually enforces.

## Request and runtime

```cpp
namespace execution = wuwe::agent::execution;

execution::execution_policy policy;
policy.default_workdir = "work";
policy.max_limits.timeout = std::chrono::seconds(3);
policy.max_limits.max_code_bytes = 64 * 1024;
policy.max_limits.max_stdout_bytes = 64 * 1024;
policy.max_limits.max_stderr_bytes = 64 * 1024;

execution::execution_runtime runtime(
  execution::make_controlled_process_backend(),
  policy);

const auto result = runtime.run({
  .language = execution::execution_language::python,
  .code = "print(6 * 7)",
});
```

`execution_request` carries code, stdin, working directory, limits, environment values, shell intent, and metadata. `execution_result` reports exit status, termination reason, timeout or cancellation, truncation, output, diagnostics, elapsed time, and backend metadata.

Only Python is implemented in 0.1.0.

For arbitrary executables and an explicitly enabled shell adapter, use the
separate [Process toolkit](process-tools.md). It is argv-first and does not
overload Python code execution with command-string semantics.

## Policy

`execution_policy` controls:

- allowed languages;
- default working directory;
- readable and writable roots;
- maximum code, input, output, process, memory, CPU, and elapsed limits;
- network, file-read, file-write, and shell permissions;
- approval requirements for network, writes, and shell use;
- allowed environment values.

`execution_runtime` evaluates and normalizes the request, obtains host approval when required, calls the backend, and emits audit events. A request that requires approval is denied when no approval service is configured.

## Model tool

```cpp
execution::execution_tool_provider tools(runtime);
```

The built-in tool is `run_python_snippet`. Its arguments are bounded separately from the execution request, and its timeout must stay within configured limits. Registering the provider with an agent runner does not weaken runtime policy.

## Backends

### `controlled_process`

This is the default and cross-platform backend. It starts a Python subprocess and provides interpreter probing, working-directory selection, environment filtering, timeouts, cancellation, process-tree cleanup where supported, and bounded stdout and stderr.

It is not a strong sandbox. In particular, policy flags such as network or file denial cannot by themselves prevent an ordinary child process from accessing operating-system resources. Use it only for code trusted to the degree appropriate for a controlled subprocess.

### `restricted_process`

The restricted backend is opt-in:

```cpp
execution::execution_backend_registry_options options;
options.enable_restricted_process_backend = true;
auto registry = execution::make_execution_backend_registry(options);
```

On Windows, an explicitly registered restricted backend is available when its configuration passes availability checks. It stages a minimal Python runtime, uses restricted process controls, limits inherited environment, applies filesystem boundaries, and denies network according to its reported enforcement contract.

On non-Windows platforms it is not available in 0.1.0. The default registry publishes the descriptor but does not register the factory, so `controlled_process` remains the default selection.

Container and WebAssembly backends are not implemented.

## Backend selection

`execution_backend_registry` describes backends and selects one only when its `sandbox_enforcement_contract` satisfies the requested requirements. Inspect `sandbox_backend_info` instead of assuming that a backend name implies a particular control.

The package smoke test verifies the default controlled backend, explicit restricted-backend registration behavior, and installed-package execution APIs on Windows and Linux.
