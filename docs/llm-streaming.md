# LLM streaming

Wuwe exposes provider-normalized streaming at both the client and agent-runner levels.

## Direct client streaming

```cpp
wuwe::llm_request request;
request.model = config.model;
request.messages.push_back({
  .role = "user",
  .content = "Explain streaming in two sentences.",
});

wuwe::llm_stream_callbacks callbacks;
callbacks.on_event = [](const wuwe::llm_stream_event& event) {
  if (event.type == wuwe::llm_stream_event_type::content_delta) {
    std::cout << event.content_delta << std::flush;
  }
};

const auto response = client->complete_stream(request, callbacks);
```

Normalized event types cover content, provider-supplied reasoning summaries, tool-call deltas, completion, and errors. Tool-call name and argument fragments are assembled by the higher-level runner before dispatch.

Built-in provider clients emit callbacks serially and never retain them after
`complete_stream` returns. Custom clients must also finish every callback before
returning. A `dispatching_llm_client` accepts providers that emit from multiple
worker threads and serializes those events before invoking consumer callbacks.
Consumer exceptions stop further consumer delivery, are rethrown to the caller,
and remain distinct from the backend request outcome.

## Runner streaming

```cpp
wuwe::llm_agent_run_options options;
options.callbacks.on_delta = [](std::string_view delta) {
  std::cout << delta << std::flush;
};
options.callbacks.on_tool_start = [](const wuwe::llm_tool_call& call) {
  std::cout << "tool: " << call.name << '\n';
};

const auto response = runner.complete("Use the available tools.", std::move(options));
```

Use `on_stream_event` for raw normalized stream events and `on_event` for agent lifecycle transitions such as model start, first event, tool-call assembly, tool execution, and completion.

`on_delta` contains final-answer text. `on_reasoning_delta` and `on_reasoning_done` contain only reasoning summaries supplied by the provider. Wuwe does not synthesize hidden chain-of-thought.

## Timeouts and cancellation

`llm_stream_timeout_options` separates:

- total request time;
- connection time;
- time to first event;
- maximum idle time between events.

Pass a `std::stop_token` through `llm_agent_run_options` for cooperative cancellation. `run_async()` also exposes `request_stop()`.

When a client does not offer native streaming, the runner can still report the completed response through its callback surface, but it cannot manufacture incremental transport events.

The complete executable example is `examples/src/llm_streaming_example.cpp`.
